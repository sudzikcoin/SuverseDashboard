You are a senior full-stack engineer working on the SuverseDashboard (Next.js + Prisma) project.

Goal:
I need to reuse some email addresses that were already used for testing (e.g. account signups). Please create a safe developer-only cleanup script that deletes specific test users from the database by their email addresses, so I can register them again.

Project context:
- The project uses Prisma and a SQL database (as already configured in this repo).
- There is already a working Prisma setup (schema and client).
- This cleanup is ONLY for my dev/test environment on Replit, never for production.

Requirements:

1. Create a new TypeScript file:
   - `scripts/cleanup-test-users.ts`

2. In this script:
   - Import the Prisma client used in the project (exactly the same way other scripts in `scripts/` folder do it).
   - Define an array of test emails that should be cleaned up, for example:
     - `agip31@gmail.com`
     - `agip32@icloud.com`
     - `sudzikcoin@gmail.com`
     - And you MUST leave a clear place in the code where I can easily add/remove more emails later.
   - In an `async` function, run a Prisma transaction that does:
     - Deletes any related records that would block user deletion (sessions, verification tokens, etc.) if such models exist. Use the actual model names from `prisma/schema.prisma`.
     - Deletes users with `email` in that array:
       `await prisma.user.deleteMany({ where: { email: { in: testEmails } } })`
   - Log to console:
     - How many users were deleted
     - For which emails
   - Make sure the script calls `prisma.$disconnect()` in a `finally` block.

3. Add an npm script in `package.json`:
   - `"cleanup:test-users": "ts-node scripts/cleanup-test-users.ts"`
   - If ts-node is not yet configured in this project, either:
     - Use whatever script runner is already used for other TypeScript scripts in the repo, OR
     - Add a small note in a comment explaining what dependency is needed.
   - Prefer to reuse the existing pattern used by other `scripts/*.ts` files.

4. Make sure the script is idempotent and safe:
   - If a user with a given email doesn’t exist, the script should not throw — it should just log something like “No user found for X”.
   - Do NOT hardcode anything dangerous (like deleting all users). Only delete by the list of emails.

5. After implementing:
   - Briefly summarize in a new Markdown file:
     - `TEST_USER_CLEANUP.md`
   - In this file, explain:
     - What the script does
     - How to run it on Replit (for example: `npm run cleanup:test-users` in the Shell)
     - That it is for DEV/TEST only.

6. Run a quick self-check:
   - Ensure the imports match the existing Prisma client usage.
   - Ensure there are no TypeScript errors.
   - If possible, run the script once against the current dev DB (with at least one of the emails that already exists) and confirm in a comment that it completed successfully.

Do NOT change any auth logic, forms, or UI. Only add the cleanup script, npm script, and the small documentation file.
