Fix the admin dashboard runtime error related to EmailTestCard and make sure the admin Dashboard page opens without React errors. Here is what I need you to do step by step: 1) Search the entire project for EmailTestCard. Identify: - The file where EmailTestCard is defined (if it exists). - All places where EmailTestCard is imported and used (most likely on the admin dashboard page). 2) On the admin dashboard page (for example something like app/admin/page.tsx, app/(admin)/dashboard/page.tsx or similar), do the following: - If EmailTestCard is imported at the top, remove that import line. - In the JSX, remove the <EmailTestCard /> component from the layout or replace it with a simple placeholder <div> so that the page can render without this component. Example replacement (only if needed): <div className="rounded-xl border border-slate-800 bg-slate-900/60 p-4 text-sm text-slate-300">Email test widget is temporarily disabled.</div> 3) If there is a separate file that defines EmailTestCard (for example in components/...), leave it as-is for now. The main goal is that the admin dashboard page no longer tries to render EmailTestCard at all, so React will not see undefined as a component. 4) Make sure there are no remaining unused imports or TypeScript errors after removing EmailTestCard. Clean up any import that becomes unused on that page. 5) Run the dev server / preview and test: - Open the admin login page, log in as admin. - Use the burger menu to go to the Dashboard page. - Confirm that the Dashboard page opens successfully with no red “Unhandled Runtime Error” overlays, and that the previous error about EmailTestCard no longer appears. 6) If there are ANY other references to EmailTestCard that cause errors, remove those usages as well in the same way (remove import and JSX usage), keeping the rest of the UI intact. Do NOT change anything related to WalletConnect, sessions, audit logs, companies, accountants, inventory, or purchase orders. Only touch the EmailTestCard usage so that the admin Dashboard is fully stable again. After all changes, summarize what files you modified and confirm that the admin Dashboard now works without runtime errors.
