REPLIT AI — CREATE ACCOUNTANT↔COMPANY LINK (PRISMA UPSERT)

GOAL
Create (or confirm) a link in Prisma table `AccountantClient` between:
- an existing accountant user (found by email), and
- an existing company (found by legal name or by id).
This enables the accountant to upload/manage that company’s documents.

INPUTS (edit these constants inside the script)
- ACCOUNTANT_EMAIL: the accountant’s login email (e.g., "felix@example.com")
- COMPANY_LEGAL_NAME: the company legal name shown in UI (e.g., "Felix LLC")
- (Optional) COMPANY_ID: if you prefer, allow using a known companyId instead of name

SCOPE — ADD/EDIT ONLY
1) Add a small script at `scripts/linkAccountantToCompany.ts` that:
   - Loads NextAuth/Prisma environment (DATABASE_URL).
   - Looks up `User` by email and verifies role === "ACCOUNTANT".
   - Looks up `Company` by legalName (or uses COMPANY_ID if provided).
   - Performs Prisma `upsert` on `AccountantClient` using a unique composite (accountantId_companyId).
   - Prints a concise summary: accountantId, companyId, status: "created" | "already-exists".
   - Exits with non-zero code and a readable message if anything is missing.

2) Update `package.json` scripts:
   - "link:accountant": "tsx scripts/linkAccountantToCompany.ts"
   (Reuse existing tsx/dev tooling; do NOT add new deps.)

3) Do NOT change schema, auth providers, roles, Stripe, or UI.

EXECUTION
- Run: `npm run link:accountant`
- On success, the console must show something like:
  ✔ Linked accountant {userId} to company {companyId} (status: created|already-exists)

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS
1) Running the script with a valid accountant email AND existing company succeeds.
2) Re-running the script is idempotent (reports "already-exists", no duplicates).
3) After linking, the accountant can open Clients → Documents modal for that company and:
   - upload a file successfully,
   - see it immediately in the list,
   - use Open/Delete actions without 403 errors.

GUARDRAILS
- If the user is not found, or not role "ACCOUNTANT" → abort with a clear error.
- If the company is not found → abort with a clear error.
- Do not modify any other data or roles.

OUTPUT
- Print the path of the created script and the updated package.json entry.
- Single commit message:
  chore(dev): link accountant to company via Prisma upsert (no schema/auth changes)
