You are a senior full-stack engineer working on my Next.js 14 + TypeScript project in this Replit. The goal is to make email verification work reliably with Resend using my verified domain **suverse.io**.

Current situation:
- Resend domain **suverse.io** is verified.
- In Replit Secrets I have:
  - RESEND_API_KEY = my valid Resend API key
  - RESEND_FROM = "no-reply@suverse.io"
- However, when I register a new user, the Replit console still shows logs like:
  - "[EMAIL] SANDBOX MODE: Email will only be delivered if recipient is the Resend account owner"
  - The Resend API error 403:
    "You can only send testing emails to your own email address (sudzikgroup@gmail.com). To send emails to other recipients, please verify a domain at resend.com/domains, and change the `from` address to an email using this domain."
- This means the code is still using the sandbox from address **onboarding@resend.dev** instead of my RESEND_FROM value.

Your task:
1. Locate all email-related code:
   - Especially:
     - `lib/email/resendClient.ts` (or similar)
     - `lib/auth/emailVerification.ts`
     - any files that send verification emails or use Resend
     - any legacy SendGrid integration code
   - Also open the documentation files:
     - `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_STATUS.md`
     - `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_AUDIT.md`
     - any scripts in `scripts/` related to Resend, like `test-resend-email.ts`.

2. Fix the **from address** logic:
   - Make sure ALL Resend email calls explicitly set `from` to **process.env.RESEND_FROM**.
   - Do NOT hard-code `onboarding@resend.dev` anywhere in the repo.
   - If there is a variable like `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`, either:
     - make it read from `process.env.RESEND_FROM`, or
     - remove it and use RESEND_FROM consistently.
   - If RESEND_FROM is missing, log a clear error and never silently fall back to onboarding@resend.dev. Instead:
     - log something like "[EMAIL] ERROR: RESEND_FROM not configured" and skip sending.

3. Clean up legacy SendGrid usage:
   - If there is still SendGrid-based mailer code that is no longer needed for this project, disable it or clearly separate it so that verification emails use ONLY Resend.
   - Make sure the verification flow uses the Resend client you fixed, not old SendGrid functions.

4. Improve logging for debugging:
   - In the central Resend client, add detailed but safe logs:
     - When sending an email, log:
       - the recipient (`to`)
       - the **from** address being used
       - the email type (e.g. "verification")
     - On Resend API error, log:
       - status code
       - error name
       - error message
   - Do NOT log the API key or any secrets.

5. Add or fix a small test script:
   - In `scripts/test-resend-email.ts` (or create it if missing), implement a simple Node script that:
     - reads `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_FROM` from env
     - sends a plain text test email to a target address
   - Make the script accept recipient email from a CLI argument or env var, for example:
     - `npm run test:resend-email -- sudzikgroup@gmail.com`
   - Add / update an npm script in package.json:
     - `"test:resend-email": "ts-node scripts/test-resend-email.ts"`
   - Ensure the script logs success or the full Resend error.

6. Verify end-to-end in dev:
   - Restart the dev server after changes.
   - Register a NEW test user with an email like `agip32@icloud.com`.
   - Watch the Replit console:
     - Confirm the log shows **from: no-reply@suverse.io** and NOT onboarding@resend.dev.
   - Then:
     - Check the Resend dashboard → Emails:
       - Confirm an email to the test address appears.
     - Confirm that the verification email is actually delivered to the inbox (or at least to spam).

7. Final report:
   - When you finish, write a short summary in README or a new markdown file named `RESEND_SETUP_STATUS.md` with:
     - Which files were changed and why.
     - What env vars are required:
       - RESEND_API_KEY
       - RESEND_FROM (must be an email on a verified domain, e.g. no-reply@suverse.io)
     - How to run the test script:
       - exact npm command
     - How to read and interpret the new logs.

Be careful to:
- Not break any existing auth or dashboard flows.
- Not leak secrets in logs.
- Keep all changes minimal and focused on making email verification work reliably with Resend and my verified domain.
