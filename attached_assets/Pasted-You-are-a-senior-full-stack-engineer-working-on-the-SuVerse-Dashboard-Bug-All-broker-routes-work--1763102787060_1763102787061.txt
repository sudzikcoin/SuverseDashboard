You are a senior full-stack engineer working on the SuVerse Dashboard.

Bug:
All broker routes work (`/broker/dashboard`, `/broker/orders`, etc.), but `/broker/inventory` shows a blank screen with “Recovering session…”. This means the Inventory page (or one of its child components) is throwing a runtime error and crashing the app.

Your task: diagnose and fix whatever is breaking `/broker/inventory` so that it renders normally. It’s OK if the page still uses mocked data for now; stability is more important than wiring Prisma at this step.

-----------------------------
Step 1 – Reproduce and inspect
-----------------------------
1. Run the dev server.
2. Open `/broker/inventory` in the browser.
3. Check:
   - Browser devtools console for React/JS errors.
   - Server logs / terminal in Replit for stack traces.

Write down the exact error message and stack for reference while you fix the code.

-----------------------------
Step 2 – Inspect the route file
-----------------------------
1. Open the file that handles `/broker/inventory`, for example:
   - `app/(broker)/inventory/page.tsx`
   - or any component it renders like `BrokerInventoryPage`, `BrokerInventory`, etc.
2. Also inspect any components imported only on this page:
   - `InventoryTable`, `CreditPoolForm`, `BrokerLayout` overrides, etc.

Look for typical crash causes:
- Incorrect or missing imports (file paths wrong, imported name doesn’t exist).
- Using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRouter`) inside a server component without `"use client"`.
- Calling `prisma`, `getCurrentBrokerOrThrow`, or any server-only helper from a client component.
- Assuming some prop is always defined (e.g. `pools.map(...)` when `pools` is `undefined`).
- Throwing errors when `user` or `broker` is not found.

Fix any obvious issues you see.

--------------------------------------------
Step 3 – Make /broker/inventory stable (mock)
--------------------------------------------
For now, prioritize a stable UI over real data. Implement `/broker/inventory` so it renders successfully even if Prisma or auth is not yet wired.

1. If the page currently tries to use Prisma or `getCurrentBrokerOrThrow` directly and that is failing, temporarily comment out or remove that logic and replace it with a small in-file mock dataset.

2. In `app/(broker)/inventory/page.tsx` implement:

- A default exported React component that renders:
  - Page title: “Inventory”
  - Subtitle: “Manage your credit pools”
  - A header button: “Add Credit Pool” that links to `/broker/inventory/add` (or whatever route you created for adding pools).
  - A table based on mock data, for example:

  const mockPools = [
    {
      id: 'demo-1',
      program: 'C48E 2025',
      year: 2025,
      state: 'US',
      available: 250000,
      minBlock: 5000,
      pricePerDollar: 0.89,
      status: 'Active',
    },
    {
      id: 'demo-2',
      program: 'C48C 2025',
      year: 2025,
      state: 'US',
      available: 740000,
      minBlock: 10000,
      pricePerDollar: 0.90,
      status: 'Active',
    },
  ];

- Render this in a table with columns:
  - Program
  - Year
  - State
  - Available
  - Min Block
  - Price per $1
  - Status
  - Actions (e.g. a “View” button that for now can just be a placeholder or link to `/broker/inventory/demo-1`).

3. Use the same Tailwind styling as other dashboard tables (dark rows, rounded corners, etc.), but do NOT add any complex logic that could crash again.

4. At the top of the file, decide if this component should be a server or client component:
   - If you need hooks like `useRouter` or `useState`, add `"use client";` at the top and keep all code client-side.
   - If you don’t need hooks for now, keep it as a server component and use **only** static mock data.

Add comments such as:
// TODO: Replace mockPools with real data from Prisma BrokerCreditPool
// TODO: Wire broker auth and Prisma fetching once page is stable

-----------------------------------
Step 4 – Check broker guard / layout
-----------------------------------
1. Inspect the `(broker)` layout file, e.g. `app/(broker)/layout.tsx` or any `RequireBroker` component.
2. Ensure the guard logic itself is not throwing errors:
   - It should safely handle the case where `user` is null/undefined by redirecting to `/login` instead of throwing.
   - It should allow `BROKER` (and any dev roles you configured) and redirect others to `/dashboard`.

Do NOT relax or remove the guard; just make sure it doesn’t crash the page.

-----------------------------
Step 5 – Verify the fix
-----------------------------
After your changes:

1. Go to `/broker/dashboard` – it should still work as before.
2. Click “Inventory” in the broker sidebar (or open `/broker/inventory` directly):
   - The page must render without “Recovering session…” or blank screen.
   - You should see the title, description, “Add Credit Pool” button, and a table with the mock rows.
3. Check browser console and server logs:
   - There should be no runtime errors.

Only after `/broker/inventory` is confirmed stable, leave TODO comments for future Prisma integration. Do not modify other dashboards (accountant/company/admin) in this step.
