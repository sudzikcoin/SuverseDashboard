You are working on the SuVerse Tax Credit Dashboard (Next.js 14 + App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind).

Goal: FIX the BROKER portal so that:
- After a BROKER logs in, they are redirected to `/broker/dashboard`.
- The broker sees a full sidebar dashboard UI (not the empty "Welcome, Sam / Connect Wallet" page).
- All broker subpages (inventory, orders, payouts, compliance, integrations, settings, support) work and render basic content.

Please do the following steps carefully:

1) Inspect current repo
- Open the `app` directory and list all subfolders related to dashboards:
  - Existing company dashboard (usually `/dashboard` or `app/(dashboard)/...`)
  - Any existing `/broker` files or folders.
- Identify:
  - Does `app/broker/layout.tsx` exist?
  - Does `app/broker/dashboard/page.tsx` exist?
  - Does `app/broker/page.tsx` exist? (this is currently the blank "Welcome, Sam / Connect Wallet" page).
- Confirm which file is responsible for the page the user currently sees when logged in as BROKER.

2) Fix post-login routing for BROKER
- Open `app/post-login/page.tsx` (or equivalent post-login router).
- Ensure the role-based routing block looks like this (adjust naming to match the actual code):

  - If `user.role === 'BROKER'`:
      redirect to `/broker/dashboard`
  - If `user.role === 'COMPANY'`:
      redirect to `/dashboard`
  - If `user.role === 'ACCOUNTANT'`:
      redirect to `/clients`
  - If there is an `ADMIN` role:
      redirect to `/admin`

- Remove any redirect that sends BROKER users to `/broker` root or to `/dashboard`.

3) Ensure `/broker` root redirects to `/broker/dashboard`
- If `app/broker/page.tsx` exists and renders a simple empty page (“Welcome, Sam / Connect Wallet”), change it to a server component that immediately redirects to `/broker/dashboard`:

  - Import `redirect` from `next/navigation`.
  - In the default component, call `redirect('/broker/dashboard')`.
  - This guarantees that visiting `/broker` always lands on the main broker dashboard.

4) Create/repair broker layout with sidebar
- Implement `app/broker/layout.tsx` if it does not exist, or update it if it is empty.
- Reuse the EXISTING company dashboard layout as a template:
  - Find the current dashboard layout used for `/dashboard` (likely in `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` or similar).
  - Copy its structure (top navbar, main content area, etc.).
- Inside `app/broker/layout.tsx`:
  - Add a broker-specific sidebar with these menu items (links must match existing/created pages):
    1. Dashboard → `/broker/dashboard`
    2. Inventory → `/broker/inventory`
    3. Orders → `/broker/orders`
    4. Payouts → `/broker/payouts`
    5. Documents & Compliance → `/broker/compliance`
    6. API & Integrations → `/broker/integrations`
    7. Settings → `/broker/settings`
    8. Support → `/broker/support`
  - Highlight the active menu item using `usePathname()` (same pattern as in the company dashboard).
  - Make sure `children` are rendered in the main content area of the layout.

5) Implement broker pages with basic content
Create (or fix) the following broker pages so that none of them are blank and all render at least basic UI:

- `app/broker/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - Show a welcome header such as “Welcome, {brokerName}”.
  - Show simple stat cards (e.g. “Total credit pools”, “Active orders”, “Pending payouts”).
  - Use any shared `StatCard` or similar components from the company dashboard if available.

- `app/broker/inventory/page.tsx`
  - Simple heading: “Credit Pools (Inventory)”.
  - A basic table listing mock pools (id, state, year, volume, price) or, if there is already a CreditPool model and API, display real data.

- `app/broker/orders/page.tsx`
  - Heading: “Orders”.
  - Simple table with mock or real orders.

- `app/broker/payouts/page.tsx`
  - Heading: “Payouts”.
  - List of payouts (mock or real).

- `app/broker/compliance/page.tsx`
  - Heading: “Documents & Compliance”.
  - Placeholder texts or simple cards for uploading/completing compliance docs.

- `app/broker/integrations/page.tsx`
  - Heading: “API & Integrations”.
  - Placeholder description of future API keys / webhooks area.

- `app/broker/settings/page.tsx`
  - Heading: “Broker Settings”.
  - Basic form or placeholders for broker profile settings.

- `app/broker/support/page.tsx`
  - Heading: “Support”.
  - Placeholder text with support instructions.

Each page should:
- Be a server component or client component consistent with the rest of the app.
- Use existing shared components (cards, tables, typography) when possible so the UI matches the company dashboard style.

6) Role guards for /broker/*
- In `app/broker/layout.tsx` or a shared auth guard, ensure:
  - Only authenticated users with `user.role === 'BROKER'` can access `/broker/*`.
  - Non-broker users are redirected to `/dashboard` (or appropriate route).
- Use the existing session/auth helper already used by the company dashboard (do NOT invent a new auth system).

7) Manual verification (please actually run these steps)
- Run the dev server.
- Register a NEW user with role = BROKER.
- Verify email using the link.
- Log in as this broker.
- Confirm:
  - After login you land on `/broker/dashboard`.
  - You see the sidebar with all 8 menu items.
  - Clicking each item loads its page with real or placeholder content (no blank screen).
- Also test:
  - Log in as a COMPANY user and try to open `/broker/dashboard` manually → should redirect to `/dashboard`.

When everything works and the broker portal is no longer empty, summarize the exact code changes (files touched + short description) in the Replit run log.
