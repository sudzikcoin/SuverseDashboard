You are working on my SuVerse Tax Credit Dashboard project. After the last KYB/verification changes, the Preview page shows: “Hmm… We couldn't reach this app”. That means the Next.js app crashed or is not listening on the HTTP port.

Your task: diagnose and fully recover the app so the Preview works again.

1) Open the Shell/Console and:
   - Run the current start command (for this Replit) manually, usually `npm run dev` or `npm run start`.
   - Watch the output carefully and find any build/runtime errors (TypeScript, Prisma, imports, missing files, etc.).
   - If the command is already running under Replit’s runner, inspect the Logs to see the crash stacktrace.

2) Fix ALL errors you find:
   - If there are TypeScript or runtime errors related to the new company verification / EIN / EmailTestCard or any other new code, correct the imports, exports, types, and JSX so that the app compiles.
   - If Prisma complains about migrations or schema changes, run the correct commands:
     - `npx prisma migrate dev` (or the command used in this project) and then `npx prisma generate`.
   - Make sure there is no invalid `EmailTestCard` or similar component reference: either implement the component properly or remove/disable its usage so that the dashboard route renders without errors.

3) Ensure the app is actually running:
   - Confirm that the start script in package.json matches what Replit expects.
   - Make sure the app listens on the correct port for Replit (usually `0.0.0.0` with the provided PORT env).
   - Update `.replit` or the Run configuration if needed so that Replit starts the app correctly.

4) When you are done:
   - Start the app.
   - Open the root route `/` and `/login` in Preview and confirm they load without “couldn’t reach this app” or red runtime overlays.
   - Verify that the admin login still works and the main dashboard page renders successfully.

Finally, write a short summary for me:
- What was broken exactly,
- What files you changed,
- What command is now used to run the app.
