0) Global cleanup (English only)
	•	Search the repo for any Russian strings (e.g., “Подключить кошелек”, “Оплатить”, etc.) and replace them with concise English equivalents:
	•	“Подключить кошелек” → “Connect wallet”
	•	Any other Russian placeholders → clear English copies consistent with the rest of the app.
	•	Ensure no mixed-locale UI remains.

1) Wallet button in header (all dashboards)

Goal: show a “Connect wallet” button on the right side of the top header in every dashboard (company, accountant, admin).

Implementation:
	•	Create/ensure a reusable component components/wallet/WalletConnectButton.tsx that renders the same wallet connect UI we already use (do not change provider logic). Accept props { className?: string } and export default.
	•	In each dashboard header, wrap the title “Welcome, {name}” (or role specific title) and the wallet button in a flex items-center justify-between container.
	•	Files to update (create if missing / adapt to project structure):
	•	Company dashboard header: app/(company)/dashboard/page.tsx (or current path where company dashboard page is defined).
	•	Accountant dashboard header: app/(accountant)/dashboard/page.tsx.
	•	Admin dashboard header: app/(admin)/dashboard/page.tsx.
	•	If there is a shared header component (e.g., components/layout/DashboardHeader.tsx), place the change there once and use it everywhere.
	•	Visual:
	•	Left: h1 with “Welcome, {displayName}”.
	•	Right: <WalletConnectButton />.
	•	Button style: Tailwind classes rounded-full px-4 py-2 border border-emerald-400/40 hover:border-emerald-400/70 bg-transparent backdrop-blur-sm.
	•	Remove any separate wallet card from the body if present.

2) Move “Pay with USDC” to sidebar under “My Purchases”

Goal: remove the “Pay with USDC” card from dashboard content and expose it as a dedicated page accessible from the left nav directly under “My Purchases”.

Steps:
	•	Extract the existing “Pay with USDC” card/component into a new route:
	•	Create app/(company)/payments/usdc/page.tsx and render the existing USDC payment UI there (same fields, same logic). Title: “Pay with USDC”.
	•	If accountant/admin have their own dashboards, also create:
	•	app/(accountant)/payments/usdc/page.tsx
	•	app/(admin)/payments/usdc/page.tsx
	•	Keep the functionality identical; just move it out of the dashboard page.
	•	Remove the old “Pay with USDC” card from:
	•	app/(company)/dashboard/page.tsx
	•	app/(accountant)/dashboard/page.tsx
	•	app/(admin)/dashboard/page.tsx
	•	Update sidebar/nav configs for each role so a new item appears directly under “My Purchases”:
	•	Label: Pay with USDC
	•	Path per role as above (company: /payments/usdc, accountant: /accountant/payments/usdc if the routes are nested, admin accordingly).
	•	Icons: reuse the same style as other items; if using an icon set, pick a simple wallet/coin icon.
	•	Ensure the new page uses the same dark theme, rounded design, and readable text (no pale gray). Use Tailwind classes similar to other pages: text-gray-100 for labels, bg-slate-900/60 cards, rounded-2xl, soft shadows, etc.

3) Consistent styling fixes (all dashboards)
	•	Ensure all pale/low-contrast texts are updated to readable classes:
	•	Replace text-gray-400/50, text-gray-300/50, etc. with text-gray-200 or text-gray-100 where appropriate.
	•	Inputs: text-gray-100 and visible borders (e.g., border-white/10 focus:border-emerald-400/40).
	•	Cards: rounded-2xl with subtle glow: shadow-[0_0_40px_-12px_rgba(16,185,129,0.25)] on hover for CTAs.
	•	Keep the Clario-like dark theme gradients already added (do not change the color palette tokens).

4) Navigation wiring (all roles)
	•	In sidebar component(s) (e.g., components/layout/Sidebar*.tsx or role-specific nav configs), add the new link under the existing “My Purchases” link:
	•	Company sidebar: add { title: 'Pay with USDC', href: '/payments/usdc' }.
	•	Accountant sidebar: add { title: 'Pay with USDC', href: '/accountant/payments/usdc' } (adjust base path).
	•	Admin sidebar: add { title: 'Pay with USDC', href: '/admin/payments/usdc' }.

5) QA checklist
	•	No Russian words remain after search/replace.
	•	On /dashboard for each role: the header shows “Welcome, …” on the left and a “Connect wallet” button on the right.
	•	The dashboard body no longer contains the “Pay with USDC” card.
	•	Sidebar shows “Pay with USDC” directly under “My Purchases” and opens the new page.
	•	Build and preview without type errors and without React hydration warnings.

Make all changes, run the project, and confirm the three dashboards (company, accountant, admin) meet these requirements. Then summarize files changed.
