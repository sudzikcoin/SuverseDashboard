Goal: Build an MVP web app called SuVerse Tax Credit Dashboard for U.S. businesses and accountants to discover, reserve, purchase, and track transferable tax credits (ITC/PTC/45Q/48C/48E). Include roles, KYC-lite, Stripe payments, e-sign, and broker handoff.

Tech stack (use defaults unless stated)
	•	Next.js 14 (App Router) + React + TypeScript
	•	Postgres (Supabase or Replit Postgres; use Prisma ORM)
	•	Auth: NextAuth (email + password; magic link optional)
	•	Payments: Stripe Checkout (one-time + invoicing)
	•	File storage: Supabase storage (for docs)
	•	Email: Resend or Postmark (transactional)
	•	PDF generation: React-PDF or @react-pdf/renderer
	•	E-sign stub: capture typed-signature + checkbox consent; store signed PDF
	•	Deploy: Vercel (provide build & env instructions)

User roles
	•	Company (Buyer) – small/mid businesses that want to buy credits
	•	Accountant – manages one or many companies (via invites)
	•	Broker Admin (SuVerse internal) – manages inventory, compliance, final approvals

Core user stories
	1.	Sign up / Onboarding
	•	Company selects role (Company or Accountant), provides legal name, EIN (optional in MVP), contact, state, est. tax liability, and target close date (year).
	•	Upload basic docs (W-9; optional).
	2.	Marketplace
	•	Browse available tax credits (list + filters: credit type, vintage (tax year), dollar amount, price per $ of credit, min block, state restrictions, transfer window).
	•	Click an item → detail modal with terms, risks, expected discount (e.g., $0.88 per $1), required closing docs, broker.
	•	Reserve a block (soft hold for 72h), or Purchase (Stripe).
	3.	Cart / Checkout
	•	Show fees (platform + KYC fee if any), subtotal, total.
	•	Stripe Checkout → on success: create Purchase Order, status = “Pending Broker Approval”.
	4.	KYC-lite & Compliance
	•	Collect company legal name, EIN (optional), officer contact, and upload ID (PDF/image), and IRS transfer statement stub (just a placeholder PDF with fields).
	•	Store all uploaded docs in storage, link to Purchase Order.
	5.	Broker Handoff
	•	When PO is paid, create Broker Package PDF with:
	•	Cover sheet (PO#, buyer, amount, credit type, price, net)
	•	KYC summary
	•	Uploaded docs list
	•	Execution checklist
	•	Allow Broker Admin to mark: Approved / Needs Info / Rejected.
	6.	Closing & Evidence
	•	On Approved, generate Closing Certificate PDF (receipt + key terms) for the buyer.
	•	Send transactional email with the PDF to buyer + accountant.
	7.	Accountant Workspace
	•	Accountants can invite client companies by email.
	•	View clients, pending orders, download certificates.
	8.	Admin (Broker)
	•	CRUD Inventory (credit lots).
	•	CRUD buyers, orders, statuses.
	•	Audit log (who changed what).
	•	Export CSV of sales and inventory.
