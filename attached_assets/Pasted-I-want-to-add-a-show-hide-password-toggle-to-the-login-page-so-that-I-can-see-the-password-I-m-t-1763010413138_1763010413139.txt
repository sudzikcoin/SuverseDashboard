I want to add a "show / hide password" toggle to the login page so that I can see the password I'm typing.

Please do the following steps carefully:

1) Locate the login form component used on the `/login` route.
   - It might live in something like `app/login/page.tsx`, `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`, or a shared component like `components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`.
   - Identify the `<input>` element for the password field (currently it should be `type="password"` or similar, with label "Password").

2) Convert the login form component to a client component if it is not already:
   - If the file does not start with `"use client";`, add it at the very top of the component file that renders the actual password `<input>`.
   - Make sure this does not break anything else.

3) Add React state to control password visibility:
   - Introduce a `const [showPassword, setShowPassword] = useState(false);` in the login form component.
   - Change the password input so that its `type` depends on this state:
     - `type={showPassword ? "text" : "password"}`

4) Add a small toggle button or icon inside the password field area:
   - Wrap the password input in a container with `relative` positioning if needed.
   - Add a button on the right side, for example:

     - A simple text button: "Show" / "Hide"
       or
     - A minimal icon (like an eye / eye-off) using any existing icon system in the project (e.g. Lucide, Heroicons, or a simple SVG). If there is already an icon library used elsewhere in the app, use that for consistency.

   - The button should:
     - Call `setShowPassword(!showPassword)` on click.
     - Not submit the form (use `type="button"`).
     - Be accessible (add `aria-label="Show password"` / `aria-label="Hide password"` depending on state).
   - Visually, please keep the existing styling of the password input (dark theme with rounded corners) and make the toggle fit nicely on the right edge of the field (for example, absolute positioned inside the input container with some padding).

5) Make sure the toggle works on both desktop and mobile:
   - When `showPassword` is true, the password text should become visible.
   - When `showPassword` is false, the password should be masked again.
   - The layout should not break on small screens.

6) Test and verify:
   - Run the app in Preview.
   - Go to `/login`.
   - Type a password and click the new toggle:
     - Confirm that the password becomes readable when toggled on and is hidden again when toggled off.
   - Ensure the login flow still works (submitting the form with valid credentials logs in as before).
   - Make sure no React/TypeScript errors or console errors appear due to this change.

7) After implementing, summarize:
   - Which file(s) you modified.
   - How the final UI behaves for the password field.
