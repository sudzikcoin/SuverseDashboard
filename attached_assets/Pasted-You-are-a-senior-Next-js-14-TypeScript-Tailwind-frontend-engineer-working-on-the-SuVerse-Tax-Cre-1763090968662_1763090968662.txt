You are a senior Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind frontend engineer working on the SuVerse Tax Credit Dashboard project in this Replit.

Goal:
Re-enable the "Connect Wallet" button on the admin dashboard now that a real WalletConnect projectId is configured. The button currently shows "Connect Wallet (disabled)" and cannot be clicked. I want it to be an active button that opens the existing wallet connect flow.

Very important:
- Do NOT touch any database, auth, or diagnostics logic.
- Do NOT change any secrets or env variables.
- Only update the frontend React/Next.js code that renders this button.
- Keep all existing styling (colors, rounded borders, etc.) as close as possible.

Steps:

1. Locate the component that renders the admin welcome section.
   - It contains the text: "Welcome, Admin User".
   - It also renders a button with label "Connect Wallet (disabled)".
   - This is likely in a file such as:
     - `app/admin/page.tsx`
     - `app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx`
     - or a component like `AdminHeader.tsx`, `AdminHero.tsx`, etc.
   - Use project search to find the string `Connect Wallet (disabled)`.

2. Inspect the JSX for that button.
   - It will currently look roughly like:
     - `disabled`
     - and the button text string contains `(disabled)`.

3. Update the button so it is enabled and clickable:
   - Remove the `disabled` attribute (or any `disabled={true}` / `aria-disabled` logic) so the button is no longer forced into a disabled state.
   - Change the label from `"Connect Wallet (disabled)"` to just `"Connect Wallet"`.
   - If there is already an `onClick` handler that opens a wallet modal (for example using `useAppKit` or `useAppKitModal` from `@reown/appkit/react` or any RainbowKit/Wagmi hook), keep that handler exactly as is.
   - If there is no `onClick` yet, implement one that calls the existing wallet connect hook:
     - At the top of the file (in a client component with `"use client"`), import:
       - `import { useAppKit } from "@reown/appkit/react";` (or the existing wallet hook used in this project).
     - Inside the component, initialize:
       - `const { open } = useAppKit();`
     - Add:
       - `const handleConnectWallet = () => { open(); };`
     - Attach it to the button:
       - `onClick={handleConnectWallet}`.

4. Preserve styling:
   - Keep the same Tailwind classes that style the button (outline, border, font, colors).
   - If the classes include any "disabled" variants like `opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed`, remove or conditionally skip them so the button looks active.
   - The final button should visually appear as a normal primary action button.

5. Do NOT add any new validation checking the diagnostics result.
   - Assume WalletConnect is correctly configured.
   - The button should always be clickable for the admin user once the page is loaded.

6. After you update the code:
   - Run the app in Replit.
   - Navigate to the admin dashboard (`/admin` or the existing admin route).
   - Confirm:
     - The header still says "Welcome, Admin User".
     - The button text is now "Connect Wallet" (without "(disabled)").
     - The button is clickable and triggers the wallet connect modal, with no red runtime errors in the browser.

7. When finished, summarize:
   - Which file(s) you changed (with paths).
   - The exact JSX for the final "Connect Wallet" button.
   - Any imports that were added or cleaned up.
