You are a senior full-stack engineer working on my SuverseDashboard project (Next.js + Prisma).  

Problem:
The email verification screen shows “We’ve sent a verification link to <email>”, but:
- No emails appear in my Resend dashboard for that address.
- The same Resend API key is working fine in another project (PingPoint).
So this project is either not calling Resend at all, or using it with wrong config/env vars.

Your job:
Find the real root cause and fix email verification so that:
1) verification emails are actually sent via Resend,
2) they appear in the Resend dashboard,
3) they arrive in the inbox.

Important constraints:
- Do NOT ask me any questions.
- Do NOT leave TODOs for me.
- Make all changes yourself inside this Replit project and then explain what you did.
- Keep the fix minimal and safe: do not break existing auth logic.

Step-by-step tasks:

1. Locate current email verification logic
   - Find the file that sends verification emails (for example `lib/auth/emailVerification.ts`, `lib/email/*`, or similar).
   - Confirm whether it currently uses:
     - SendGrid, or
     - Resend, or
     - something else.
   - If there is an `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_AUDIT.md` or similar doc in the repo, read it and align with the current code.

2. Standardize the Resend client
   - Create (or reuse if it exists) a single wrapper for Resend, for example:
     - `lib/email/resendClient.ts`
   - In this file:
     - Import `Resend` from `"resend"`.
     - Initialize it with `process.env.RESEND_API_KEY`.
     - If `process.env.RESEND_API_KEY` is missing or empty:
       - Log a clear error in the console: `[EMAIL] Missing RESEND_API_KEY, cannot send emails`.
       - Export a safe no-op function so the rest of the app does not crash.

3. Implement a clear verification-email sender
   - Create (or update) a function like:
     - `sendVerificationEmail({ email, token }: { email: string; token: string })`
     - Location: `lib/auth/emailVerification.ts` (or another appropriate existing file).
   - This function must:
     - Build the correct verification URL used by the app (same as the current flow).
     - Call the Resend client wrapper and send an email with:
       - `from`: use the same verified “from” address that works in my PingPoint project.
       - `to`: the user’s email.
       - A clear subject like “Verify your SuVerse account”.
       - A simple HTML body containing the verification link.
     - Log:
       - `[EMAIL] Sending verification email to <email>`
       - On success, log `[EMAIL] Verification email sent successfully to <email>, id=<resendMessageId>`
       - On error, log `[EMAIL] Resend API error for <email>: <error message>`.

4. Wire it into the registration flow
   - Find where new users are created (COMPANY, BROKER, ACCOUNTANT etc.) and a verification email is triggered:
     - For example in `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` or a similar server action.
   - Make sure that:
     - After creating the user and the verification token, your code calls `sendVerificationEmail(...)` that uses Resend.
     - Any old SendGrid-specific code is removed or disabled for verification emails (no double-sending).
   - Ensure that, if Resend fails, the error is logged but the server does not crash; the user should see a generic error message if necessary.

5. Add a manual Resend test script
   - Create a dev-only script:
     - `scripts/test-resend-email.ts`
   - This script should:
     - Import the same Resend client wrapper.
     - Define a constant test email (for example `const TEST_EMAIL = "agip31@gmail.com";`).
     - Send a very simple test email: subject “Resend Test from SuverseDashboard”.
     - Log to console:
       - Whether `RESEND_API_KEY` is present.
       - The Resend response or error.
     - Call `prisma.$disconnect()` if you import Prisma for any reason, and `process.exit(0)` at the end.

6. Add an npm script
   - In `package.json`, add:
     - `"test:resend-email": "ts-node scripts/test-resend-email.ts"`
     - If another tool is already used for TypeScript scripts in this repo, reuse that tool instead of ts-node.
   - Make sure the script runs without TypeScript errors.

7. Perform a full self-check (very important)
   - Run `npm run test:resend-email` from the Replit Shell.
   - Confirm in the console that:
     - `RESEND_API_KEY` is detected (do NOT print the full key, only print something like its length or first 4 characters).
     - Resend returns a successful response with a message ID.
   - After running the script, check in the Resend dashboard that this test email appears in the logs for `agip31@gmail.com`.

8. Validate the real verification flow
   - Register a NEW test user (with a fresh email) through the normal Sign Up form.
   - Watch the Replit console logs:
     - You must see `[EMAIL] Sending verification email to ...` and the success log with the Resend message ID.
   - Check the Resend dashboard again:
     - You should see the verification email for that address.
   - If something still fails, adjust the code until both:
     - The console logs show a successful send via Resend.
     - The email appears in the Resend dashboard.

9. Final documentation
   - Update or create a short markdown file:
     - `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_STATUS.md`
   - In this file, briefly explain:
     - Which file sends verification emails now.
     - That Resend is used (not SendGrid).
     - Which env variable is required (`RESEND_API_KEY`).
     - How to manually test with `npm run test:resend-email`.

Deliverables:
- All necessary code changes implemented.
- `lib/email/resendClient.ts` (or equivalent) working.
- `sendVerificationEmail` using Resend.
- `scripts/test-resend-email.ts` + npm script.
- A short summary in `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_STATUS.md` describing what you fixed and how to test it.
