Auth is not working in Replit Preview: login does nothing and /register shows "User already exists". 
Please fix end-to-end:

1) ENV: Create/ensure `.env.local` with:
   DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="dev-secret"
   AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true
   # Detect current Preview origin and set it explicitly:
   NEXTAUTH_URL="<PUT_PREVIEW_ORIGIN_HERE>"

   • Replace <PUT_PREVIEW_ORIGIN_HERE> with the actual Preview origin (the base URL shown in the Replit Preview address bar, e.g. http://localhost:5000 or the replit preview hostname). Do this automatically.

2) Prisma: run `npx prisma generate`, then `npx prisma db push` and `npx prisma db seed`. 
   If the seed already inserted users, that's fine.

3) NextAuth config:
   • Ensure we're on NextAuth v5 style config and the auth route exists at `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`.
   • In the config set `trustHost: true` and `debug: true`.
   • Keep the Credentials provider working with email+password against Prisma (bcrypt compare).
   • Return proper errors from `authorize` so the client sees why login failed.

4) Fix duplicate during register:
   • If POST /api/register gets a duplicate email, return 409 with message "User already exists".
   • Add a temporary debug endpoint `/api/debug/delete-user` (POST, body { email }) that deletes a user by email via Prisma for development only. Guard it with `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.

5) Frontend:
   • On /login and /register show server validation errors under the button (not silently).
   • After successful register -> auto redirect to /login with a green toast.
   • Keep the increased contrast you already applied.

6) Testing:
   • Seed admin user: email `admin@suverse.io`, password `ChangeMe_2025`.
   • After server restart, I must be able to:
       - login at /login with admin@suverse.io / ChangeMe_2025
       - register a new user (Company role), then login with it

7) Restart the dev server and print server logs for the login request. 
   Confirm in a comment: 
   - current NEXTAUTH_URL value 
   - that cookies are set on login
   - and that /api/auth/session returns a session JSON.

If any path/host/cookie issue remains, detect the Preview origin programmatically and set NEXTAUTH_URL accordingly, then restart.
