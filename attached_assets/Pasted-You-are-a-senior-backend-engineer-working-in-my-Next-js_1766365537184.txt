You are a senior backend engineer working in my Next.js 14 + Prisma project on Replit. I’ve run out of test email inboxes and I need a **database cleanup** so I can reuse them.

Goal
Create a safe cleanup script that **deletes all users and related data EXCEPT admin accounts**.

Important rules
- Keep every user whose role is `ADMIN`.
- Delete ALL other users (COMPANY, BROKER, ACCOUNTANT, or any other non-admin role).
- Also delete all related records that belong only to those non-admin users:
  - Company / Broker / Accountant profiles linked to these users
  - Orders / Purchases / Holds / Payments / Credit pools created by these users’ entities
  - Auth sessions, verification tokens, password reset tokens, etc. for these users
  - Any other records that reference these users or their company/broker/accountant records by foreign key
- Do NOT delete or modify:
  - Admin user accounts
  - Any global/system configuration data that is not tied to a specific user (e.g. static reference tables, seed data we need for the app to boot).

Step-by-step tasks

1. Inspect the project:
   - Open `prisma/schema.prisma` and identify:
     - The `User` model (and its `role` field).
     - All models that link to `User` via `userId` or similar.
     - Models that link to Company/Broker/Accountant entities (for orders, purchases, etc.).
   - Also quickly scan `/lib` and `/app` to understand which models are used for:
     - Companies
     - Brokers
     - Accountants
     - Purchases / Orders / Holds / Payments
     - Sessions and tokens (e.g. NextAuth, email verification).

2. Create a cleanup script:
   - Add a new file: `scripts/cleanup-non-admin-users.ts`.
   - In this script:
     - Import `PrismaClient` from `@prisma/client`.
     - Create a function that:
       1. Logs that cleanup is starting.
       2. Queries all users where `role != 'ADMIN'`.
       3. If there are no such users, log “No non-admin users found” and exit.
       4. For the found non-admin users:
          - Collect their `id`s.
          - For each related model (companies, brokers, accountants, orders, purchases, holds, documents, files, sessions, tokens, etc.), delete records that belong to those user IDs (directly or via company/broker/accountant IDs).
          - Use the correct delete order to satisfy foreign key constraints (e.g. delete orders/purchases/holds -> then companies/brokers/accountants -> then users).
       5. Finally, delete all non-admin users.
       6. Log how many records were deleted per model and a final summary.
     - Wrap everything in a `main()` with try/catch/finally:
       - On error, log a clear error message and `process.exit(1)`.
       - Always disconnect Prisma in `finally`.

3. Add an npm script:
   - In `package.json`, add:
     - `"cleanup:non-admin-users": "ts-node scripts/cleanup-non-admin-users.ts"`  
       (adjust to whatever command you are already using for TypeScript scripts, e.g. `tsx` instead of `ts-node` if that’s what the project uses).
   - Make sure the script works with the current tooling (no missing devDependencies).

4. Safety checks in code:
   - In the cleanup script, add an extra safety guard:
     - Before deleting, log all admin users (id, email, role) and explicitly log that they **will NOT** be deleted.
     - Also log the list (or count) of non-admin users that **will be deleted**.
   - Do **not** delete any user whose `role === 'ADMIN'` even if their email looks like a test email.

5. Run the script (dev only):
   - Execute the cleanup locally in this Replit environment using:
     - `npm run cleanup:non-admin-users`
   - Confirm via logs that:
     - Admin users are preserved.
     - Non-admin users and their related records are removed without foreign key errors.

6. Verify via Prisma Studio or app:
   - If Prisma Studio is configured, you can optionally run it to double-check:
     - Admin users still exist.
     - Other users are gone.
   - Alternatively, verify through the app:
     - Try signing up again using one of the previously used emails to confirm it no longer conflicts.

7. Documentation:
   - Create a short markdown file `CLEANUP_NON_ADMIN_USERS.md` with:
     - A description of what the script does.
     - A list of models it touches.
     - The exact command to run: `npm run cleanup:non-admin-users`.
     - A clear warning that it will delete **all non-admin accounts and their data**.

Constraints
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the cleanup script and minimal adjustments needed in `package.json`.
- Do not change existing business logic, routes, or auth flows.
- Do not log any secrets.

When finished, briefly summarize in the cleanup markdown how many models are affected and confirm that only non-admin users are removed.
