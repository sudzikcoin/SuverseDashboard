You are working on my SuVerse Tax Credit Dashboard project (Next.js + App Router + WalletConnect / Reown AppKit).

Goal: replace the temporary "demo" WalletConnect projectId with my REAL one and fully fix WalletConnect config so there are no warnings or format errors anywhere (including the Diagnostics page).

My real WalletConnect / Reown projectId is:

dbf430b2322a29addf78d5b0235a9492

Follow these steps:

1) Secrets: set correct env var
- Open the project’s Secrets in Replit.
- Find or create the key:
  NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID
- Set its value EXACTLY to:
  dbf430b2322a29addf78d5b0235a9492
- Remove any old placeholder values like "demo" or "test".
- Save the secret.

2) Ensure the app uses this env var
- Search the codebase for:
  NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID
  and for "projectId" inside WalletConnect / AppKit config.
- Make sure the WalletConnect / AppKit config uses:
  const projectId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID!;
- Do NOT hardcode "demo" or any other string. Only use the env var.
- If there is any custom “warning” banner in the UI that complains about missing/invalid WalletConnect projectId, update its validation logic so it accepts a 32-character hex string and reads from NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID. It must consider the value
  dbf430b2322a29addf78d5b0235a9492
  as valid and therefore NOT show any warning.

3) Diagnostics page integration
- Open the System Diagnostics / Release Checklist / WalletConnect section in the code.
- Update its validation to:
  - Check that the env var exists.
  - Check that its length === 32.
  - Optionally, check that all chars are valid hex.
- After you wire the real projectId, the Diagnostics page must show WalletConnect as passing (green / OK) and no longer show messages like:
  “WalletConnect projectId has invalid format (expected 32 hex chars)”.

4) Clean up old hacks / placeholders
- Remove or disable any previous “temporary fix” that:
  - forced a fake projectId like "demo";
  - bypassed WalletConnect initialization;
  - or rendered a persistent orange warning banner at the top of the app.
- The app should now initialize WalletConnect / AppKit normally with the real projectId and without any custom error overlays.

5) Test
- Run the app in Replit.
- Open the Diagnostics / System Health page and verify:
  - No WalletConnect format warning.
  - WalletConnect / AppKit passes all checks.
- Also test the normal user/admin flow:
  - Open the landing page.
  - Login as admin.
  - Confirm there is NO orange WalletConnect banner and NO red WalletConnect error popup.

6) Summary
- When you are done, summarize EXACTLY which files were changed and what was modified in each file (only WalletConnect / AppKit / Diagnostics related changes and secrets usage).
